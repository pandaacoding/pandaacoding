### Hi there 👋

My friend call me Panda. 

## What I Do

🌐 FME Developer | GIS & IT Specialist | Cybersecurity Enthusiast 🛡️.

## Bio
With over 8 years of hands-on experience in the GIS and IT industry. I started my career as a GIS technician where I develope my map making and GIS skills. I was introduce to FME very early on in my career and I love it!!! FME is a must for any GIS users. But FME doesn't only help with your spatial related tasks. It can connect to over 480+ extension files including BigData, Cloud, Databases, Excels, XML, anything you can thing of, they have it. I've honed my skills as an FME Developer, passionate about automating tasks and streamlining processes. Through a blend of FME wizardry and scripting in SQL, Python, and PowerShell. I create solutions that elevate productivity and efficiency not only just for GIS, but for IT as well! I recognize the symbiotic relationship between GIS and IT infrastructure which introduce me to information Security. Understanding the critical role of security in this dynamic ecosystem. I ensuring that every tool I develop is not only functional but also safe against potential threats.

I'm currently pursuing Master's in Cybersecurity. I aim to fortify the GIS industry with resilient and secure tools, safeguarding critical data and infrastructure from malicious actors.

Let's connect and collaborate on building a safer, smarter GIS landscape together! 🌍🔒
